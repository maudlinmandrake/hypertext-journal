1. Getting ready for my summer position as a teaching assistant with Girls Who Code! I'll be assisting online summer camps, teaching high school girls how code with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
2. Spending the entire year reading Michel de Montaigne's *Complete Essays* - I'm reading about five pages a day, which is the pace I need to finish by the end of the year
3. Starting to lift weights again, using programming by *Stronger by the Day* from the comfort of the home gym my husband and I put together.
4. Working on my JavaScript certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/maudlinmandrake).
