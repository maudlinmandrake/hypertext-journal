1. School; this semester it’s college algebra and content management systems.
2. Thinking about goals; my struggle to nail down what I want in my life, how to make goals, how to stick with goals to get tangible results. I seem to be incapable of all of the above and it’s…frustrating. 
3. Thinking about this blog and my struggle to write on a regular basis.
4. My daughter’s reading abilities have exploded, so we’re trying to spend more time at the library. We found out she spends half her day at school reading. She has seemingly skipped past beginner’s readers books and is reading stuff largely meant for middle schoolers. 
5. I’ve lost most, if not all, interest in web development. Maybe it was the botched interview I had months ago for a supposedly junior position (the questions didn’t feel like they were meant for a junior), which made me deeply question my ability to do this. I’ve instead been focusing on iOS development and learning SwiftUI, which feels far less overwhelming and it has been a lot more fun.
6. Studying tarot in my free time. Using a database that built in Notion to create encyclopedia entries for all of the cards, tracking readings, how many times cards come up, etc.
