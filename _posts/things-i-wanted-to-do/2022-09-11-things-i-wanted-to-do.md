Every year I ride the high of hope that comes with the changing of the calendar.  I make a lot of promises that I could probably pull off when at my very best, but never really take into consideration what I’m usually capable of (which, quite frankly, isn’t much). I know people usually stop to think about these things at the end of December, but the fall is when my brain starts reflecting. Maybe it’s the 15+ years of compulsory schooling. Maybe it’s something deeper, ancestral. Samhain[^1] is the start of the Gaelic New Year, marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of Winter. It is a liminal festival, both literally metaphorically: it is a space between fall and winter, and it was also when the veil between our world and the spirit world is thinnest.

Either way, this is when my brain begins navel-gazing, so I thought I’d catalog all the things I wanted to do but didn’t. Not to berate myself, but to just sorta…take stock. Review. Step back from it all and get the big picture.

1. Devote myself to reading classic literature and old books deeply and slowly.
2. Have a Depth Year, in which I do not buy any new books, courses, tools, start any new hobbies, or take on any new skills
3. Develop a meditation practice
4. Write regularly here on my blog
5. Move my body regularly
