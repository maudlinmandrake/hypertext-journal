Jenny was born and raised in front of a computer, spending much of her childhood and teen years on Geocities, Livejournal and AOL Zine World. She's also a dedicated bibliophile who got chubby on all of the personal pan pizzas she earned for reading while in elementary school, and she dreams of working through all of the Great Books. She's an art school dropout returning to school in her 30s to learn how to code because she wants to get paid to make cool things on the Internet. She has spent the past six years as a stay-at-home mom, working as a barista on the weekends to get out of the house. She lives in Indianapolis with her husband, daughter, and the family cat, Mochi. 

She's studying at Ivy Tech Community College and works as a teaching assistant for Girls Who Code's summer virtual immersive program.
