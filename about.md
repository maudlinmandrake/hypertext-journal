Jenny was born and raised in front of a computer, spending much of their childhood and teen years on Geocities, Livejournal and AOL Zine World. They're a dedicated bibliophile who got chubby on all of the personal pan pizzas she earned for reading while in elementary school, and  dreams of working through all of the Great Books. They have spent the past six years as a stay-at-home mom, and is now back in school studying software development. They live in Indianapolis with their husband, daughter, and the family cat, Mochi. 

Currently spending their summer as a teaching assistant for Girls Who Code's summer virtual immersive program.
