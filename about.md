## About the Site

This website largely serves as an Internet homestead of sorts, where I can putter around in the garden, read by the fireplace, or write at the kitchen table. It is my attempt to disconnect and pull back from my dependency on social media. I want maintain a meaningful web presence much like I did when I was younger, when everything I wrote and made belonged to me, and was stored in a space I owned. I've been largely inspired by the [IndieWeb Principles](https://indieweb.org/principles), the work of [Winnie Lim](http://www.winnielim.org/) and [Buster Benson](http://www.busterbenson.com), not to mention free services like [Neocities](http://neocities.org/) that encourage people to carve out small & strange personal spaces again.

Right now I feel very homeless on the web, with bits and pieces of me scattered to the four winds. This is my space to pull it all back in. I hope you'll join me at the kitchen table: I'll put the kettle on.
